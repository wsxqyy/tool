   Hello! This is an English readme file, this file is a robot translation, and there are some shortcomings.
## admin SL log
  This is an open-source SCP: SL (SCP: Secret Laboratory) server admin log interpreter. You can open your admin log files through the web, allowing you to quickly analyze the logs.

# Demo
## You can visit a demo website set up by Xueqiu Bqiu on GitHub for a quick experience: 
V1.0 :https://wsxqyy.github.io/tool/   
V2.0：https://wsxqyy.github.io/tool/SL_V2.0/
After visiting the website, you will see the following:

## Please upload your file: xxxx-RAlog.txt (where XXXX represents your server's port, for example, mine is 8000. Note: Do not upload other files, such as ServerLog-7777.txt)

## When the file XXXX-RAlog.txt appears here (mine is 8000-RAlog.txt, this depends on the filename you choose.)

## For example, I search for a user named "Xueqiu"

## We can see data, and you can click "Export to Excel" to export the data in Ex format. Note: The export is not all data! It is the part you searched for!

# What should I pay attention to when searching?
## Search Example:
Suppose you want to search for records of a user named "Xueqiu", you can enter "Xueqiu" in the search box and click the search button. The search results will show all data for the user named "Xueqiu".
## Search for a specific time:
If you want to search for records of a specific time, the time format is "17/12/2024" which is day/month/year.
## Notes:
### The search is case-insensitive.
#### The search is based on text matching. If the search term is multiple words, it will find matches in any text containing those words.
##### If the search term is too short or too common, it may return a large number of results. In this case, trying to use more specific keywords may yield better results.
